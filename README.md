## About the repository

The ideia is focusing on testing. This is a simple Node project to execute tests for JS files.
ESM (EcmaScript Modules) is used and configured for testing.

### Installing

Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/DiogoZdev/Jest && cd Jest
```

Installing dependencies

```
npm install
```

executing the tests

```
npm test
```

## What is TDD ?

TDD stands for Test Driven Development.
The core idea behind TDD is to define test cases and expectations upfront, ensuring comprehensive coverage of scenarios, including edge cases, before writing the production code.

Preparing the tests before the development has some advantages:

- Writing tests first allows developers to clearly define the expected behavior of the code. This serves as a blueprint for implementation and helps in maintaining alignment with project requirements.
- TDD removes the cognitive burden of remembering all the must-follow rules and requirements while coding. Developers can focus solely on the coding process, knowing that the tests will ensure compliance with the defined specifications.
- Developers can receive real-time feedback on the correctness of their implementation. As they write code, they can immediately see whether it passes the pre-defined tests, enabling rapid iteration and debugging.
